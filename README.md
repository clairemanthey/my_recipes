## Introduction
Welcome to my recipe site. I began this site using the Gatsby starter [Hello Word](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world/). I found design inspiration in the cookbook The Joy of Cooking. The design focuses on the information in the recipe resulting in a simple and clean design without any fluff. 

I used the Contentful CMS to manage the content. It allowed me to add new recipes, change old ones, and add in my alternations to each recipe. I included tags for each recipe to make them easy to find based on a category. 

## Motivation
I created this site as a way to easily access recipes I enjoy and keep track of how I changed them. I wanted a simple, clean recipe site with just the information for that recipe. I had previously been storing them as screenshots on my phone and tried to remember the adaptations I made.
